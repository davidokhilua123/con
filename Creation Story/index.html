    <h1>Poem On "Creation Story" By Emmanuel And David</h1>
    <h4>And God stepped out of space,</h4>
    <h4>And he looked around and said;</h4>
    <h4>I'm Lonely.</h4>
    <h4>I'll make a world,</h4>
    <h4>As God's eyes could go far.</h4>
    <h4>He could only see a vast darkness,</h4>
    <h4>Like a hundred-fold of midnight.</h4>
    <h4>Then God smiled;</h4>
    <h4>And the darkness broke;</h4>
    <h4>And the light stood on his own;</h4>
    <h4>And God said: That's good.</h4>
    <h4>And from the light,</h4>
    <h4>He swung his hands and formed the sun from the light.</h4>
    <h4>He made the sun as a ball and flung it;</h4>
    <h4>Against the darknes,</h4>
    <h4>And configurated the moon and the stars from the darkness,</h4>
    <h4>And God said: That's good.</h4>
    <h4>Then God himself stepped down,</h4>
    <h4>And the sun on his right hand,</h4>
    <h4>And the moon was on his left hand,</h4>
    <h4>The stars were around his head,</h4>
    <h4>And the earth under his feet.</h4>
    <h4>As he walked on the earth;</h4>
    <h4>His feet caused the mountains;</h4>
    <h4>And the valley to sprout up.</h4>
    <h4>Then He looked and saw</h4>
    <h4>That the earth was hot and barren,</h4>
    <h4>And so from his mouth he spat out an ocean body-</h4>
    <h4>And he slapped his hand and lightening came to be-</h4>
    <h4>He stompted his feet and the thunder roared.</h4>
    <h4>Then the green grass sprouted,</h4>
    <h4>And the flowers flourised,</h4>
    <h4>The vine trees pointed their fingers to the sky;</h4>
    <h4>The oak tree spread forth hs branches.</h4>
    <h4>The roots of the the trees and plants spread forth their roots;</h4>
    <h4>And God smiled;</h4>
    <h4>And the rainbow appeared;</h4>
    <h4>And curved round his shoulders;</h4>
    <h4>And God said: That's good.</h4>
    <h4>Then God raised his hand,</h4>
    <h4>And said: Bring Forth! Bring Forth!</h4>
    <h4>And before hands dropped;</h4>
    <h4>The seas covered with fishes;</h4>
    <h4>The forest with beast and fowls</h4>
    <h4>And birds seperate the clouds with their wings,</h4>
    <h4>And God smiled;</h4>
    <h4>And said: That's good.</h4>
    <h4>Then God checked all he created,</h4>
    <h4>The moon, stars, and sun;</h4>
    <h4>And he said: Am lonely still.</h4>
    <h4>He sat at the edge of a mountain,</h4>
    <h4>God thought and thought;</h4>
    <h4>And said: Let me fabricate man in thy image.</h4>
    <h4>The lord who made the sun,</h4>
    <h4>Flung stars far to the corners of the earth,</h4>
    <h4>Foureged the sun from the light,</h4>
    <h4>Moulded the earth into shape with his hands.</h4>
    <h4>God Almighty knelt down and scooped soil from the earth;</h4>
    <h4>And began crafting a masterpiece;</h4>
    <h4>Then he blew the breath of life;</h4>
    <h4>And man became a living soul.</h4>
    <h2>Amen! Amen!</h2>
